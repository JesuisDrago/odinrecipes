# odinrecipes
I created this miniproject so that I can get familiar with the basic functions of HTML by creating a few webpages featuring 3 recipes. I had to write the code, add the images, creating unordered and ordered lists, identing each line corectly so that I can set up a good foundation for future bigger projects.
