    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>6 rye bagels - split, toasted, and cut into 1/2-inch pieces</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded Swiss or provolone cheese</li>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, cut into 1/2-inch pieces</li>
            <li>8 ounces hot-smoked salmon, skin removed, coarsely flaked</li>
            <li>8 large eggs, lightly beaten</li>
            <li>2 cups whole milk</li>
            <li>1/2 cup sour cream, plus more for serving</li>
            <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh dill, plus more for garnish</li>
            <li>capers and lemon wedges, for serving</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><h4>Step1</h4></li>
                <p>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Coat a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.</p>
            <li><h4>Step2</h4></li>
                <p>Spread half of the toasted bagel pieces in prepared dish. Top with 1 1/2 cups Swiss cheese, the cream cheese, and smoked salmon. Top with remaining bagel pieces.</p>
            <li><h4>Step3</h4></li>
                <p>Whisk together eggs, milk, sour cream, and dill in a bowl. Pour over mixture in baking dish. Press bagel pieces with the back of a spoon to coat in egg mixture.</p>
            <li><h4>Step4</h4></li>
                <p>Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes. Sprinkle with remaining 1/2 cup cheese. Bake 5 to 10 minutes more, until set and an instant-read thermometer inserted into center of casserole registers 160 degrees F (71 degrees C). Let stand about 10 minutes before serving. Garnish with additional dill and serve with capers, lemon wedges, and/or additional sour cream.</p>
